Linked List:
       - Go back to Scheme
       - car and cdr
       - Each group of car and cdrs is a node
       - The connections between them is a LINK!

Each list has TWO things, the first element and a reference to the rest of the list
Can have everything be an Object (the car can be a reference to something and the cdr can be too)

What operations would you like to perform on a linked list:
     - get(int index)
     - set(int index)
     - add(Object o)
     - isEmpty()
     - remove(int index)
     - addAll(LinkedList l)
     - subList(int start, int end)
     - indexOf(Object o)
     - size()
     - toString()
     - set(int index, Object o)
