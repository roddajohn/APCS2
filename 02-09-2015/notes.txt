GOAL: Amazing things happen in APCS

Binary Trees: You either do something or you don't

Group Sum: {8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9}
You either include the 8 in the sum or you don't
Then you either include the 6 or you don't for both of the paths of the previous question.
This creates a tree.
Program would complete one brach before going down another, the stack can only be as deep as deepest branch.
